After cloning the repo you'll need to install dependencies using:

npm install

# or

yarn

Then, run the development server:

npm run dev

# or

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

How might you make this app more secure?

- user autentification & data hashing
- input validation and sanitization

How would you make this solution scale to millions of records?

- better ways to display data when having millions of records:

1. using tables to display notes and categories
2. being able to search by table column, not only note title
3. adding search functionality to categories list
4. adding filter functionalities
5. adding sorting as table col functionalitiy
6. adding pagination

i think this would allow the users to navigate through the app and manage their notes in a better way
